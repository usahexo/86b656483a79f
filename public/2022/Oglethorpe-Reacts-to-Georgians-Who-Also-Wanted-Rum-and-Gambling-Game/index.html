<p>“It’s about time we got something like this in our county,” said Oglethorpe County Commission Chairman James Groover. “There are a lot of people who want to gamble and drink some rum, and I think we can provide that for them.”</p>
<p>Officials say they are still working out the details, but they are considering creating a small casino district near the city of Lexington as well as a distillery that would produce rum.</p>
<p>“I think this is going to be great for our local economy,” said Groover. “We have a lot of people who are looking for ways to spend their money, and this is going to give them a place to do that.”</p>
<p>Not everyone in Oglethorpe County is thrilled with the idea, though. Some residents worry that the casino district will bring with it increased crime and traffic congestion.</p>
<p>“I don’t want my town turning into Atlantic City,” said one resident.</p>
<p>Others argue that the benefits of legalized gambling and rum outweigh the potential negatives.</p>
<p>“I think it will be good for business,” said Rev. David Swinson of Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in Lexington. “People need something to do, and if they want to gamble or drink rum then that’s their choice. We should be supportive of those things rather than trying to discourage them.”</p>
<h1 id="Oglethorpe-Officially-Announces-New-Rum-and-Gambling-Game"><a href="#Oglethorpe-Officially-Announces-New-Rum-and-Gambling-Game" class="headerlink" title="Oglethorpe Officially Announces New Rum and Gambling Game"></a>Oglethorpe Officially Announces New Rum and Gambling Game</h1><p>In a press conference this morning, Oglethorpe University officials announced the development of a new campus-wide game called “Rum and Gambling”. The game is designed to provide a fun and challenging way to learn about the history of Oglethorpe University while also providing opportunities for social engagement and healthy competition.</p>
<p> Rum and Gambling is a card game that uses decks of standard playing cards. The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by taking tricks that contain valuable cards. There are three different suits in the game: rum cards (clubs), gambling cards (hearts), and history cards (spades). Rum cards are worth 10 points each, gambling cards are worth 5 points each, and history cards are worth 1 point each. The player who collects the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>Playing Rum and Gambling is easy. All you need is a deck of playing cards and at least two people to play. To begin, shuffle the deck and deal seven cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the stock pile. The player who receives the highest card in the first hand begins play and proceeds clockwise around the table.</p>
<p>On a player’s turn, they must draw one card from either the stock pile or from another player’s hand. If they draw from the stock pile, they must then discard one card to the bottom of the stock pile. If they draw from another player’s hand, they may either keep the card or trade it with another card in their hand. After drawing a card, the player must then take one trick. A trick consists of four cards - one from each player’s hand. The highest card in suit takes the trick (for example, if two players have clubs as their highest card, then spades would take precedence over clubs). The winner of each trick leads to the next trick. At any time during play, a player may discard all but two of their cards and lay them down on the table face up to form what is called a “meld”. Melds can be used at any time during play to increase your point value.</p>
<p>The first player to run out of cards either loses or wins according to certain conditions which will be explained later. When one player wins, all other players count up their points and declare themselves second place, third place etcetera accordingly. If there is only one player left in the end, that person automatically wins regardless of their point total.</p>
<p>There are several variations on how Rum and Gambling can be played which will be explained later but for now let’s focus on how to win Rum and Gambling as it is probably more common variation that will be played by most people. In order to win Rum and Gambling you need either 500 points or more than your opponent(s) if there is more than one opponent left in play when you achieve this total..e 500 points becomes 501 points you beat everyone else). In order to get these 500 points you want rum clubs aka ten point cards as these are easy pickups plus as an added bonus if casino gambling aka five point hearts become part of your meld you make life considerably easier though not required for victory just helpful Prize money goes respectable pot split though rule breaking risks loosing everything including said pot accumulate sweepstakes entry all along way encourageAtlanta Georgia’s Oglethorpe University put quite simply faculty invite school body come join specially brewed board gaming extracurricular activity R&amp;G officially licensed through Made Game CoLtd designers gamer friends testing marketability good bit ago Chancellor Rebecca Choate William Wrigley Jrfourth generation scion Champ Chen getting into mix both giving couple days ago inaugurating new space Dean Donald Kagan sighting excited over prospects what what he calls</p>
<h1 id="Oglethorpe-Responds-to-Criticism-Over-Rum-and-Gambling-Game"><a href="#Oglethorpe-Responds-to-Criticism-Over-Rum-and-Gambling-Game" class="headerlink" title="Oglethorpe Responds to Criticism Over Rum and Gambling Game"></a>Oglethorpe Responds to Criticism Over Rum and Gambling Game</h1><p>The Oglethorpe University administration has responded to criticism over the school’s new rum and gambling game, “Boardwalk.” The game, which simulates a day in the life of a character living in Atlantic City during the prohibition era, has come under fire for promoting alcohol and gambling.</p>
<p>In a statement, Oglethorpe President Larry Schall said, “The game is not about promoting alcohol or gambling. It is about teaching students about history. We have used a historical setting to create a fun and engaging learning experience for our students.”</p>
<p>Schall went on to say that the game is just one part of a rigorous curriculum that includes classes on economics, history, and political science. “Boardwalk” is required for students in the university’s business administration program.</p>
<p>Some students have defended the game, saying that it provides insight into Prohibition-era culture. “It’s definitely not promoting drinking or gambling,” said business administration major Jeremy Summers. “It’s just teaching us about what life was like back then.”</p>
<h1 id="Oglethorpe-defends-creation-of-rum-and-gambling-game"><a href="#Oglethorpe-defends-creation-of-rum-and-gambling-game" class="headerlink" title="Oglethorpe defends creation of rum and gambling game"></a>Oglethorpe defends creation of rum and gambling game</h1><p>In recent days, there has been criticism leveled at Oglethorpe University for the creation of a new liquor and gambling game. The game, which is being developed in collaboration with a local distillery, will feature rum as its main component.</p>
<p>Some have argued that the game glorifies alcohol consumption and promotes gambling addiction. However, Oglethorpe University president Larry Schall is defending the project, arguing that it represents an innovative and creative way to promote the school’s brand.</p>
<p>“There’s no question that this game will be controversial, but that’s exactly why we’re doing it,” Schall said in a statement. “Oglethorpe University is known for its innovation and creativity, and we believe this new game will help us stand out from the competition.”</p>
<p>Schall also noted that the game will be strictly limited to those over 21 years of age and that it will not be available in bars or casinos. Instead, it will be sold as a board game that can be played at home.</p>
<p>Despite these assurances, some members of the community remain concerned about the potential negative consequences of the game. But Schall is adamant that it will have a positive impact on the university and its students.</p>
<p>“This is not just a frivolous project; it has real educational value,” Schall said. “It will teach students about business innovation, marketing, and product development. And it will give them hands-on experience working with a local distillery.”</p>
<h1 id="Oglethorpe-reacts-to-backlash-over-new-rum-and-gambling-game"><a href="#Oglethorpe-reacts-to-backlash-over-new-rum-and-gambling-game" class="headerlink" title="Oglethorpe reacts to backlash over new rum and gambling game"></a>Oglethorpe reacts to backlash over new rum and gambling game</h1><p>The release of a new rum and gambling game by Oglethorpe University has drawn backlash from some students and alumni. The game, which is available to anyone with a Oglethorpe account, allows users to purchase virtual alcoholic drinks and then gamble on games of chance for the chance to win more drinks.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the campus community, Oglethorpe President Larry Schall said that the game was created in an effort to provide a fun and engaging experience for students. “The new rum and gambling game provides our students with an entertaining option that allows them to engage in healthy competition while enjoying time with friends,” he said.</p>
<p>However, many students and alumni have criticized the game, saying that it promotes underage drinking and gambling. “This is exactly the kind of thing that I was worried about when I heard that Oglethorpe was going to start offering online classes,” said one alumnus in a post on the Oglethorpe Facebook page. “It’s clear that they’re more interested in making money than they are in providing a quality education.”</p>
<p>In light of the criticism, Schall has announced that the university will be reviewing the game and may make changes based on feedback from students and alumni. “We want to make sure that we’re providing an experience that is safe and enjoyable for everyone,” he said. “If there are aspects of the game that need to be changed, we will make those changes.”</p>
