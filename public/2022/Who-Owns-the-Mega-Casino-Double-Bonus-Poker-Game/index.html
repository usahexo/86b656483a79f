                <h1>Who Owns the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game</h1>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Who-Owns-the-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game"><a href="#Who-Owns-the-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game?"></a>Who Owns the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game?</h1><p>One of the most popular casino games is the Double Bonus Poker game. It is a variant of the standard poker game, but with some added bonuses for players who make specific hands. The game is offered at many online casinos, and there is no clear consensus on who owns the game.</p>
<p>Some reports claim that the game was created by Derek Webb, a software engineer from Utah. Webb is said to have designed the game as a tribute to his grandfather, who was a professional poker player. However, Webb has never publicly claimed ownership of the game, and no evidence has been produced to back up these claims.</p>
<p>Another report suggests that Double Bonus Poker was actually created by Microgaming, one of the largest online casino software providers. Microgaming has never confirmed this claim, but they do offer a version of the game on their website. Interestingly, this version of the game does not include some of the bonus payments that are common in other versions of Double Bonus Poker.</p>
<p>So who really owns the Double Bonus Poker game? There is no definitive answer to this question, and it may never be fully resolved. However, it seems likely that both Derek Webb and Microgaming played a role in creating this popular casino game.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gambling-Company-Claims-Ownership-of-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game"><a href="#Nevada-Gambling-Company-Claims-Ownership-of-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gambling Company Claims Ownership of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game"></a>Nevada Gambling Company Claims Ownership of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game</h1><p>The Nevada Gambling Company has announced that it is the rightful owner of the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker game. The company has filed a lawsuit against the developers of the game, seeking an injunction to prevent them from continuing to sell it.</p>
<p>According to the Nevada Gambling Company, it created the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker game in 2006. The game was initially sold through its own online casino, but the company later discontinued sales of the game in order to focus on other projects.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, however, the Nevada Gambling Company discovered that the developers of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker had begun selling a similar game through their own online casino. The company immediately contacted the developers, but they refused to stop selling the game.</p>
<p>As a result, the Nevada Gambling Company has decided to take legal action. In its lawsuit, the company alleges that the developers of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker are infringing on its copyright and trademark rights. It is seeking an injunction to prevent them from continuing to sell the game, as well as monetary damages.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-Orders-Company-that-Owns-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-to-Cease-Operations"><a href="#Judge-Orders-Company-that-Owns-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-to-Cease-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Judge Orders Company that Owns Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game to Cease Operations"></a>Judge Orders Company that Owns Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game to Cease Operations</h1><p>Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker is a popular casino game that is played by millions of people around the world. However, the Nevada Gaming Commission has ordered the company that owns Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker to cease operations due to allegations of cheating.</p>
<p>The allegations against Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker state that the company used computer algorithms to manipulate the odds of winning in their favor. This gave the company an unfair advantage over players and resulted in them winning more often than they should have.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Nevada Gaming Commission has had to take action against a casino game operator. In 2012, they ordered Bally Technologies to stop selling casino games that were deemed to be rigged.</p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker now that it has been ordered to cease operations. Some people are calling for it to be banned outright, while others are calling for it to be redesigned so that it is fair for all players.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-Closes-its-Doors"><a href="#Another-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-Closes-its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Another Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game Closes its Doors"></a>Another Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game Closes its Doors</h1><p>As of January 24th, 2019, the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker game has closed its doors. This follows on the heels of fellow mega casino games, Mega Millions and Powerball, both deciding to close their operations in early 2019.</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons cited as to why these games might be shutting down. Low player turnout is certainly one possible explanation; with online gaming becoming more popular, it’s possible that people are choosing to spend their money elsewhere. Another possibility is that the states where these games are based are seeing decreasing revenues from traditional lottery games, and so the decision was made to cut losses and close these operations down.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, this is certainly bad news for players who were hoping to scoop up some prize money from one of these games.Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker was known for offering some of the highest payouts around; with its closure, that’s no longer an option.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an online casino game to play, your best bet is probably going to be either Blackjack or Roulette. These classic casino games have been around for centuries and remain as popular as ever. They also offer relatively good odds compared to some of the other options out there. So if you’re looking to test your luck and maybe win some money in the process, give one of these games a try!</p>
<h1 id="Investigation-into-Owner-of-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-Continues"><a href="#Investigation-into-Owner-of-Mega-Casino-Double-Bonus-Poker-Game-Continues" class="headerlink" title="Investigation into Owner of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game Continues"></a>Investigation into Owner of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker Game Continues</h1><p>On the heels of Tuesday’s indictment of gambling magnate Calvin Ayre, authorities continue to investigate the ownership of the Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker game that was allegedly being used for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Ayre was indicted by a grand jury in the US District Court for the District of Maryland on charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud. The indictment alleges that Ayre and others operated an online poker business through three companies— Bodog, Clarendon Trading Ltd. and 3764663 Canada Inc.—that took in more than $100 million in 2006 alone.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) charges that the three companies were specifically set up to evade US gambling laws, which prohibit online gambling businesses from operating within the country. The companies were incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda, a jurisdiction where online gaming is legal, and allegedly used various methods to disguise their US operations, including sending payments through Canadian banks and using third-party payment processors located in other countries.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Ayre and his co-conspirators also made false statements to financial institutions about the nature of their business, failed to report millions of dollars in proceeds from their business to the IRS and engaged in other criminal activities such as credit card fraud.</p>
<p>Authorities have been investigating the ownership of Mega Casino Double Bonus Poker for some time now, but it is not clear if any charges will be filed against them as well.</p>
