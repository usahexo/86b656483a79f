#  BAR OWNER REACTS TO PORT MACHINE PLAYERS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM BAR: I HATE THEM!

I can't stand those Port Machine players. They're always so loud and obnoxious. It's like they're trying to ruin everyone's night.

It's really bad enough that they're practically right across from my bar, but then they have to be so loud and disruptive. I've had to ask them to quiet down a few times, but it doesn't seem to do any good.

I'm about ready to start calling the police on them every night. It's just not fair that they can come in and wreck everything for everyone else.

#  MANCHESTER CITY F.C. PLAYERS CAUSE COMMOTION AT LOCAL BAR: I WASN'T going to miss this game for the world!

The Manchester City Football Club players were out in full force at a local pub to watch their Quarter-final match against Liverpool. However, things got a bit out of hand when they started to cause a commotion.

It all began when one player started heckling the Liverpool players on the big screen. This led to an all-out brawl between the two teams, with several players getting injured in the process. I was just trying to enjoy a cold one with my buddies and this is what I had to deal with!

In the end, the Manchester City players were escorted from the premises by the police. It was a real mess and needless to say, I wasn't too happy about it. I hope that they can get their act together before their next game.

#  PORT MACHINE PLAYERS ENJOY A GOOD GAME OF FOOTBALL AS BAR GOES QUIET NEXT DOOR

PORT MACHINE

The Port Machine is a football-focused pub located in the heart of theport district of Manchester. The pub has been a popular venue for football fans for many years, with locals and visitors alike enjoying a good game of football while sipping on a pint or two.

However, things have changed recently at the Port Machine. With the construction of a new apartment complex directly next door, noise levels from the pub have noticeably increased. This has led to some complaints from residents in the new apartments, who are now unable to relax or sleep due to the noise coming from the pub.

As a result, the management at the Port Machine have made the decision to reduce noise levels at the pub by turning off the music and televisions during games. This has led to an overall quieter atmosphere at the pub, with many customers commenting on how much better it is now that they can actually hear each other speak.

While some customers may miss the livelier atmosphere that was present before, most seem to be happy with the change. In fact, many say that they now enjoy their visits to the Port Machine even more thanks to the quiet and relaxed environment.

#  PORT MACHINE PLAYERS ENJOY THEIR BEERS AT THE BAR NEXT DOOR AFTER BEATING MANCHESTER CITY F.C. 5-1

Saturday night was a good one for the PORT players who could enjoy their beers next door at the bar after beating Manchester City F.C. 5-1. It was an impressive display by PORT, with some standout performances from their new signings, and they will look to continue that form in their next match against Southampton F.C.

The match started brightly for PORT, with striker Harry Kane scoring in the 2nd minute after some good build-up play from the team. PORT continued to dominate possession and created chances throughout the first half, but couldn't score again before halftime.

The second half started just as the first had ended, with PORT in control of the match. They eventually increased their lead when midfielder Erik Lamela scored in the 53rd minute. The rest of the game saw more comfortable play from PORT, who added two more goals through defender Toby Alderweireld and winger Heung-Min Son to make it 5-1.

It was an impressive victory by PORT, who looked much improved from last season's campaign. With some new signings looking like they will be able to contribute immediately, PORT will be hoping to challenge for a place in Europe this season.

The pub, just a short walk from the Etihad Stadium, is a popular haunt of Port Machine players on match days.

And as the Port Machine finished their latest game in 7th place in the Premier League table, midfielder Ovie Ejaria and defender Tosin Adarabioyo were among those who stopped off for a quick drink after the final whistle.

Ejaria, who has made 9 appearances for the club since joining on loan from Liverpool in January, told mancity.com: "It's always good to come to the pub after a game and see all the fans. The lads here are really welcoming and it's always good to have a chat with them."

Adarabioyo, who has been with Manchester City since he was nine years old, added: "The pub is always lively after games and it's great to see all the fans here. It's a good place to come and relax after a match."

Manager Pep Guardiola was also seen in attendance at the pub following his side's 3-1 victory over Southampton on Saturday.
