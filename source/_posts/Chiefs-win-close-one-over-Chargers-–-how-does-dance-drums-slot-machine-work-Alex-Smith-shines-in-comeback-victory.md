#  Chiefs win close one over Chargers – how does dance drums slot machine work Alex Smith shines in comeback victory

The Kansas City Chiefs were able to hold on for a close 24-20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 1 of the NFL season. The game was not without controversy, as Alex Smith appeared to fumble the ball late in the fourth quarter with the Chiefs leading by four points. However, the officials ruled that the call was an incomplete pass, and the Chiefs were able to run out the clock for the win.

Smith had an excellent game overall, throwing for 251 yards and two touchdowns. He also showed his athleticism by scrambling for a 13-yard touchdown in the third quarter. Rookie running back Kareem Hunt also had a strong debut, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown.

The Chargers were led by Philip Rivers, who threw for 246 yards and two touchdowns. Keenan Allen had a big game, catching six passes for 92 yards and a touchdown. However, it wasn’t enough to overcome the Chiefs’ offense.

The Chiefs will look to build on this win next week when they face off against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Chargers will try to get back on track when they take on the Miami Dolphins.

#  Chiefs offense looks unstoppable in rout of the Patriots

The Kansas City Chiefs offense looked unstoppable on Sunday Night Football, scoring 38 points in a rout of the New England Patriots. Patrick Mahomes was spectacular, throwing for 352 yards and four touchdowns. Tyreek Hill had a huge night, catching six passes for 169 yards and three touchdowns. Travis Kelce also had a big game, catching eight passes for 142 yards and a touchdown.

The Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs' high-powered offense. The Chiefs marched up and down the field at will, scoring touchdowns on their first five possessions. The Chiefs racked up 546 total yards of offense, the most ever against the Patriots.

This was a statement game for the Chiefs, who showed that they are one of the best teams in the NFL. With Mahomes playing at this level, the Chiefs are going to be tough to beat this season.

#  Reid's offense continues to impress in win over Cincinnati

In what might have been the most impressive performance of the young season, the Philadelphia Eagles steamrolled the Cincinnati Bengals 34-13. Led by quarterback Carson Wentz and a dominant ground game, the Eagles offense looked unstoppable.

The running back duo of Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount gashed the Bengals defense for a combined 193 yards on 29 carries. Ajayi led the way with 91 yards on 12 carries, including a 71-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that essentially put the game away.

Blount was equally effective, averaging over six yards per carry. The veteran running back has now topped 75 yards from scrimmage in each of his last three games with Philadelphia.

Wentz continued his impressive start to the season, completing 22 of 31 passes for 304 yards and two touchdowns. He spread the ball around effectively, connecting with eight different receivers. Nelson Agholor had a big day, catching six passes for 86 yards and a touchdown.

The Eagles' offensive explosion was too much for Cincinnati to overcome. The Bengals managed just 263 total yards and were held to a paltry 3-of-14 on third down conversions. Andy Dalton was sacked four times and threw two interceptions.

The win improves Philadelphia's record to 2-1 and keeps them in first place in the NFC East. They will look to continue their winning ways next week when they take on the Los Angeles Chargers.

The Saints then had one final chance to win the game, but the Chiefs defense was able to come up with a big stop to seal the victory.

It was an impressive win for the Chiefs, who have now improved their record to 5-1 on the season.

#  Crazy come-from-behind victory over the Broncos sends Chiefs to the playoffs

Trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs scored two touchdowns in quick succession to take the lead. They then sealed the victory with a late interception by Marcus Peters.

It was a truly remarkable performance by the Chiefs, who had appeared to be out of contention just a few minutes earlier.

"We never stopped believing," said quarterback Alex Smith. "We knew we could do it if we just kept fighting."

The victory means that the Chiefs will now face the Titans in the first round of the playoffs. It's sure to be an exciting matchup, and KC fans will no doubt be hoping for another dramatic victory.
