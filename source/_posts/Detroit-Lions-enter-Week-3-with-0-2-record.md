#  Detroit Lions enter Week 3 with 0-2 record

The Detroit Lions entered Week 3 of the NFL season with an 0-2 record after losing back-to-back games to the New York Jets and San Diego Chargers. In Week 3, the Lions will host the Green Bay Packers at Ford Field.

The Lions struggled offensively in their first two games of the season, averaging only 15.5 points per game. Matthew Stafford threw for only four touchdowns and was intercepted three times in those games. The Lions will need to improve offensively if they hope to compete with the Packers this week.

The Packers come into Week 3 with a 1-1 record after beating the Chicago Bears and losing to the Minnesota Vikings. Aaron Rodgers threw for five touchdowns and was intercepted zero times in those games. The Packers are a very tough opponent, but the Lions have home field advantage and can't be counted out yet.

This should be a very exciting game to watch and it will be interesting to see which team comes out on top.

#  Detroit Lions cap off week 3 preparations with spirited session

The Detroit Lions capped off preparations for their Week 3 game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Wednesday with a spirited session.

Offense appeared to have the upper hand during practice, as Matthew Stafford connected with Marvin Jones Jr. and Golden Tate on a pair of deep balls. Kenny Golladay also made a leaping catch in the back of the end zone during red zone drills.

On the other side of the ball, defensive end Ezekiel Ansah appeared to be back to his old self, wreaking havoc in the backfield throughout practice. He was able to get pressure on Stafford and even had a sack during team drills.

Ameer Abdullah continues to make a case for more carries, breaking off a couple of long runs during practice. Theo Riddick also looked sharp in his limited role, catching a couple of passes out of the backfield.

The Chargers present a difficult challenge for the Lions this week, but if Wednesday’s practice is any indication, Detroit should be up for the task.

#  Detroit Lions look to rebound against Atlanta Falcons

Coming off a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Detroit Lions will look to rebound against the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons are led by quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones. Ryan has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL in recent years, while Jones is one of the best receivers in the league.

The Lions have several weapons on offense, including quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receivers Golden Tate and Marvin Jones Jr. Stafford is coming off a poor performance against the Vikings, but he is still one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. Tate and Marvin Jones Jr. are both dangerous receivers who can make big plays.

The Lions will also have to contend with reigning MVP running back Todd Gurley. Gurley had a huge season last year, and he is expected to have another big year this year. The Lions’ defense will need to come up with a strong performance if they want to win this game.

The Falcons are a very talented team, but the Lions should be able to compete with them. If Stafford plays well and the defense can make some stops, the Lions could pull off an upset victory.

#  Detroit Lions cap second preseason game with win 

DETROIT - The Detroit Lions capped their second preseason game with a win on Saturday night.

The Lions went into halftime leading the Buffalo Bills 14-7, and then pulled away in the second half for the 24-10 victory.

"I thought it was a good team win," Detroit head coach Matt Patricia said after the game. "There were a lot of guys that stepped up and made some plays."

OFFENSE

Rookie running back Kerryon Johnson led the way for Detroit on offense, carrying nine times for 53 yards and a touchdown. He also caught two passes for 18 yards.

"Kerryon is doing a great job," Patricia said. "He's making some tough yards."

Second-year quarterback Jake Rudock completed 11 of 19 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 47 yards on six carries.

DEFENSE

Lions cornerback Nevin Lawson intercepted two passes, returning one for a touchdown. Defensive end Cornelius Washington also had a sack.

#  Detroit Lions preseason finale

The Detroit Lions preseason finale is a chance for the starters to get some final work in before the regular season begins. There are some things to watch for in this game.

First, the Lions need to see if they can get their running game going. They have been inconsistent so far in the preseason, and they need to find a way to move the ball on the ground.

Second, they need to shore up their defense. They have given up too many points in the preseason, and they need to fix that before the regular season starts.

Finally, they need to figure out who is going to be their starting quarterback. Matt Stafford has been solid, but they may want to give Jake Rudock a chance to show what he can do.

All of these things will be important as the Lions try to make a run at the playoffs this year.
