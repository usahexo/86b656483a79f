#  How casinos cheat at roulette: Part 1 – The specifics of roulette wheel bias

Casinos have many ways to cheat their customers, but the most common method is to use a biased roulette wheel. In this two-part article, we will be taking a look at how casinos can use bias to their advantage, and how you can spot a biased wheel.

The Basics of Roulette Wheel Bias

Roulette wheels are designed so that the chances of each number coming up are equal. However, because the design is not perfect, there is always a small chance that a particular number will come up more often than others. This is what we call wheel bias.

There are several factors that can affect wheel bias, including the manufacturing process, the type of materials used, and even the environment in which the wheel is used. As a result, it can be difficult to spot a biased wheel without expert knowledge.

How Casinos Use Wheel Bias

Casinos use wheel bias to their advantage by placing more money on certain numbers when they know that the wheel is biased in their favour. This gives them an edge over the other players at the table, as they are more likely to win when they bet on these numbers.

Spotting a Biased Wheel

It can be tricky to spot a biased wheel without knowing what to look for. However, there are some signs that you can look out for. The most obvious sign is if more numbers seem to be coming up on one side of the wheel than the other. You can also watch out for clumps of balls landing in certain areas of the wheel or patterns developing over time. If you see any of these signs, it may be worth betting on the opposite side of where the bias seems to be strongest.

#  How casinos cheat at roulette: Part 2 – The different ways to rig roulette tables

In the first part of this series, we looked at how casinos can cheat at roulette by installing rigged wheels. In this article, we will take a look at different ways that casinos can rig roulette tables to ensure that they make a profit.

One way that casinos can rig roulette tables is by using biased wheels. Casinos can use different techniques to bias wheels, such as weighting certain pockets more than others or using a tilted wheel. This means that the ball is more likely to end up in certain pockets, which allows the casino to predict where it is going to land and bet accordingly.

Another way that casinos can rig roulette tables is by using sleight of hand techniques. This involves the croupier or dealer manipulating the game in order to give the casino an advantage. For example, they may switch balls during play or hide winning bets. They may also “accidentally” drop losing bets on the floor so that they can’t be paid out.

Finally, casinos can also use software to rig roulette tables. This involves installing software on the table that predicts where the ball is going to land. This allows the casino to place bets accordingly and ensure that they make a profit.

#  How casinos cheat at roulette: Part 3 – Tips to avoid being cheated yourself

In this final part of our series on how casinos cheat at roulette, we present some tips to help you avoid being cheated yourself.

Tip 1: Be aware of how casinos can manipulate the odds

As we have seen, casinos can use a number of methods to cheat at roulette. One of the most effective ways to minimise your chances of being cheated is to be aware of how these methods work. For example, be aware of how casinos can manipulate the odds by using biased wheels or by using ‘ controlled shooting’ . By knowing how these methods work, you can take steps to protect yourself from being taken advantage of.

Tip 2: Use a good roulette system

Another way to protect yourself from casino cheating is to use a good roulette system. There are many different systems available online, and it is important to choose one that has been proven to work. A good system will help you make better decisions when betting and will help you to minimise your losses if the casino does try to cheat.

Tip 3: Play at reputable casinos

Finally, one of the best things you can do to protect yourself from casino cheating is to play at reputable casinos. These casinos have a good reputation for fair play and they are less likely to engage in dishonest practices. If you do encounter any problems while playing at a reputable casino, they are more likely to investigate and resolve the issue quickly and fairly.

#  How precise do casinos cheat at different roulette games? 
Roulette games offer casino players the opportunity to win big payouts, with a relatively small investment. Casinos, however, are not in the business of simply giving away money and, as a result, employ various strategies to tilt the odds in their favour. In some cases this may involve cheating, although not all casinos resort to this measure.

The precise way in which a casino may cheat at roulette depends on the game being played. There are three main variants of the game – American Roulette, French Roulette and European Roulette. The first two variants are similar, with the only difference being that American Roulette has an additional slot (or "double zero") on the wheel. European Roulette only has one zero slot. 

One way that casinos can cheat at American Roulette is by placing a small ball inside the double zero slot. This ball is heavier than the other balls used in the game and will cause the roulette wheel to slow down as it comes to a stop, resulting in more spins of the wheel for the casino and less payouts for players.

Another way that casinos can cheat at American Roulette is by using multiple wheels with different winning outcomes pre-loaded into them. The house edge is increased when playing with multiple wheels because players are more likely to make bets on specific numbers that correspond with one of the wheels, rather than all numbers on a single wheel.

Cheating at French Roulette is more difficult for casinos because there is only one zero slot on the wheel. One way that they can still gain an advantage over players, however, is by loading extra balls into specific slots on the wheel that have been assigned lower payouts than other slots. This will cause more balls to come to rest in these lower payout slots and gives the casino an increased chance of winning when these bets are placed.

European Roulette cannot be cheated by casinos in quite the same way as American or French Roulette because there is only one zero slot on the wheel. This makes it more difficult for them to control which numbers players bet on and results in fairer gameplay for consumers.

#  Casino Secrets: How Casinos Cheat at Roulette

It's no secret that casinos make a lot of money from roulette. In fact, roulette is one of the casino's most profitable games. So, it's no surprise that casinos employ various methods to tilt the odds in their favour. Here are some of the ways they do it:

1) The casino might use a biased wheel. This is a wheel that has been subtly weighted in such a way that the odds are tilted in the casino's favour.

2) The casino might use stacked chips. This is when the casino places chips on top of each other, so that they form a tower. This makes it more difficult for players to see how much money they are betting. It also makes it more difficult for them to pick up their winnings quickly.

3) The casino might use cheating devices. There are all sorts of cheating devices out there, and casinos often use them to gain an edge over players. Some of these devices include false decks of cards, scanners that can read hidden markings on dice, and software that can predict the outcome of spins.

4) The casino might employ croupiers who are dishonest. Some croupiers may deliberately miscount bets or incorrectly pay out winnings. They may also help the casino by informing them when particular players are on a winning streak, so that they can be targeted with additional bets.

5) The casino might use surveillance cameras to track player behaviour. If the casino suspects that a player is counting cards or using some other technique to gain an advantage, they will keep track of their playing behaviour using surveillance cameras.
