#  Maryland Taxes Gambling Wages at 5.75 Percent

As of July 1, 2019, Maryland taxes gambling wages at 5.75 percent. This tax is imposed on the gross amount of wages paid to an employee for services performed in connection with gambling activities.

The 5.75 percent tax applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, betting on sporting events, and lotteries. It does not apply to winnings from gambling activities, which are taxed as income.

Gambling income includes both the profits generated by wagering and any payouts received from winning bets. Income generated from hosting or operating a gambling business is also taxable.

This tax is separate from the state's 6 percent tax on casino slot machines. In addition, Maryland imposes a 10 percent withholding requirement on all winnings over $5,000 from any form of gambling.

#  How Much Taxes Do You Have to Pay on Gambling Winnings in Maryland?

In Maryland, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This means that you are required to report your winnings on your tax return and pay taxes on them. The amount of taxes you will have to pay depends on how much you won and your income tax bracket.

For most taxpayers, the gambling income tax withholding rate is 25%. However, higher rates may apply if your gambling winnings are considered “net” prizes. In addition, you may be required to pay state and local income taxes on your gambling winnings.

It is important to note that only gambling winnings that are taxable are subject to tax withholding. Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling winnings, but they cannot be used to reduce your taxable income. As a result, you may end up owing additional taxes when you file your return.

If you have questions about how much taxes you have to pay on gambling winnings in Maryland, please contact a tax professional.

#  Taxes on Gambling Wages in Maryland

Gambling in Maryland is subject to taxation on all wages earned. This includes both casino and race track wage income. Tax rates are graduated, starting at 2% for the first $1,000 of wages and rising to 5.75% for wage income over $15,000. The amount of tax due is reported annually on Form MD-1040, Line 14.

Since gambling income is considered taxable wages, it is also subject to federal income tax withholding. The withholding rate is based on the number of exemptions claimed on the employee’s W-4 form. For example, if an employee claims one exemption, then 7% federal withholding would be applied to gambling income.

Taxes on gambling wages are a important source of revenue for the state of Maryland. In fiscal year 2018, taxes withheld from gambling wage income amounted to over $24 million.
