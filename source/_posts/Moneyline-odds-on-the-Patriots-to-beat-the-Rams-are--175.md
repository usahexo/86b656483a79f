#  Moneyline odds on the Patriots to beat the Rams are -175

The Patriots are set as the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year, with odds of -175 on the moneyline. The Rams, on the other hand, have odds of +155 to win.

Why are the Patriots favored?

There are a few reasons why the Patriots are favored. Their experience is one factor – they have been to more Super Bowls than any other team, and they know how to win. Tom Brady is also a big reason they are favored. He is considered one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history, and he has led the Patriots to victory in some of the biggest games.

What do the Rams need to do to win?

The Rams will need to play their best football if they want to upset the Patriots. They will need to score touchdowns instead of settling for field goals, and they will need to stop Brady and the Patriots’ offense. The Rams’ defense has been good this year, but it will be tough to stop Brady and company.

#  Moneyline odds on the Rams to beat the Patriots are +155

The Rams opened as 2.5-point underdogs to the Patriots in Super Bowl LIII, with the moneyline odds on Los Angeles to win at +155. Bettors continue to back the Rams, who are now 4-point underdogs as of Thursday morning.

This line appears to be largely based on public perception,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) with the majority of bets coming in on the Patriots. The move from +2.5 to +4 indicates that there’s been a bit of repricing by sportsbooks, with more money coming in on New England.

Despite the lopsided betting, some sportsbooks have started shading their lines towards the Rams, indicating that they may believe there is value on taking Los Angeles at these odds. CG Technology has the Rams at +3 while William Hill has them at +2.5.

There’s still plenty of time for things to change, but it will be interesting to see if this line begins moving even further in favor of the Rams as we get closer to kickoff on Sunday.

#  Moneyline odds on the Eagles to beat the Saints are +170

The Philadelphia Eagles will be taking on the New Orleans Saints this upcoming weekend in a highly anticipated Divisional Round game. The Saints enter as 7-point favorites according to moneyline odds, which are currently set at -240. The Eagles, meanwhile, are +170 underdogs.

If you’re hoping to make some money on this game, the smart play may be to back the Eagles. Even though they’re underdogs, they present excellent value at +170. The Saints have been dominant this season, but they are not unbeatable. New Orleans has lost four times this year, and three of those losses came against teams that are now either out of the playoffs or playing in lower-tier matchups. The Eagles have proved that they can compete with the best teams in the league, so there’s no reason to think that they can’t pull off an upset against the Saints.

Of course, there is always risk when betting on a team that is not favored to win. If the Eagles lose, you will likely end up losing your bet. But if you believe in this team and think they can pull off the upset, then gambling on them at +170 could be a wise decision.
