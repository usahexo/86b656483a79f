#  San Antonio Spurs start selling out games as playoffs near

The San Antonio Spurs have been one of the most consistent teams in the NBA over the past few years. They always seem to be in the playoff hunt, and they always have a chance to make a deep run in the postseason. This year has been no different, as the Spurs currently sit in fifth place in the Western Conference.

And as the playoffs near, fans are starting to take notice. The Spurs are now starting to sell out their games, as attendance has skyrocketed in recent weeks. This is a testament to the team’s success this season, and it should give them even more motivation to make a run in the playoffs.

San Antonio has always been one of the best teams in the NBA when it comes to fan support. But with Kawhi Leonard and Co. playing at such a high level this season, that support is only going to continue to grow. If you haven’t had a chance to see them play live yet, now is definitely the time to do so. The Spurs are on fire right now, and they show no sign of slowing down anytime soon.

#  Kawhi Leonard shines as San Antonio Spurs start to sell out games

The San Antonio Spurs, in many ways, are the envy of the NBA. They have a perennially contending team, a passionate fanbase and a great coach in Gregg Popovich. However, there was one thing that has been lacking in recent years – sellouts.

This has all changed recently, as Kawhi Leonard has taken over as the face of the Spurs. His stellar play has led to packed houses at the AT&T Center, with fans eager to see him take on all challengers.

Leonard’s rise to stardom began in earnest during the 2014-15 season. He averaged 21 points and seven rebounds per game while shooting almost 50 percent from the field. This led to his first All-Star selection and helped San Antonio reach the playoffs for the 18th consecutive year.

The Spurs would eventually lose to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs, but Leonard’s breakout performance had shown that he was ready to lead this team into battle.

This was further confirmed during the 2015-16 season. Leonard averaged 25 points and five rebounds per game while shooting almost 48 percent from the field. He also led San Antonio all the way to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to eventual champion Golden State Warriors.

It is safe to say that Kawhi Leonard is now one of the best players in the NBA. This was evident recently when he was unanimously voted MVP of the 2017-18 NBA All-Star Game. In that contest, Leonard scored a game-high 29 points while also grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out five assists.

There is no doubt that Kawhi Leonard is one of the most complete players in basketball today. He can score inside and outside, rebound effectively and also make plays for his teammates. Not to mention, he plays with a passion and intensity that is rare in today’s NBA Players Association dominated environment.

So far this season, Kawhi Leonard is averaging 26 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists per game while shooting almost 49 percent from three point range (!). These numbers are simply mind blowing, and have made him an even bigger superstar than he was before.

#  San Antonio Spurs make it to playoffs; sellout streak continues

The San Antonio Spurs clinched a berth in the NBA playoffs for the 20th consecutive year with a 112-106 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night. It also marked the 394th consecutive home game sold out at the AT&T Center, continuing the longest active sellout streak in all of professional sports.

Coach Gregg Popovich spoke about how proud he is of his team for making it to the playoffs once again and for continuing to achieve remarkable sellout streaks.

"It just speaks to the loyalty of our fans," Popovich said. "They continue to come out and support us no matter what. I'm just thrilled that we can keep giving them a good product and make them proud."

The Spurs will take on either the Golden State Warriors or New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, with Game 1 scheduled for Saturday, April 14th.

#  Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs continue their winning ways, even with less tickets sold

The San Antonio Spurs have been a powerhouse in the NBA for years now, led by head coach Gregg Popovich. Even with ticket sales down this year, the Spurs continue to win.

One of the biggest reasons for their sustained success is their focus on team basketball. The Spurs don’t rely on any one player to carry them to victory; they work together as a unit. This approach has paid dividends in the past, and it continues to do so today.

Another key factor in the Spurs’ success is their stability. Unlike some teams, which make frequent roster changes, the Spurs have had largely the same core of players for many years now. This consistency has allowed them to develop strong chemistry and know what each other is capable of.

Finally, Gregg Popovich deserves credit for his role in the Spurs’ success. He is a great coach and motivator, and he knows how to get the most out of his players. He has been with the Spurs for over two decades now, and during that time he has won five NBA Championships. There’s no doubt that he is one of the best coaches in NBA history.

The San Antonio Spurs may not be selling as many tickets as they have in past seasons, but that doesn’t mean they can’t win games. With Gregg Popovich at the helm, they are poised to continue their winning ways for years to come.

#  How will the San Antonio Spurs fare in the playoffs this year?

The San Antonio Spurs have been one of the most consistently successful teams in the NBA over the last two decades. However, they have not won a championship since 2014. This year, they are once again contenders for the championship.

 Led by superstars LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs will be a tough opponent for any team in the playoffs. However, there are some questions about their ability to win a championship this year.

First of all, Leonard has been hampered by a calf injury and it is not clear if he will be able to play at full strength in the playoffs. Additionally, the Spurs have struggled late in the season, losing six of their last 10 games.

If Leonard can return to form and the Spurs can recapture their earlier season form, they could very well make it to the NBA Finals and win their sixth championship.
