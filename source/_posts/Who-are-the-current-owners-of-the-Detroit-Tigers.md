#  Who are the current owners of the Detroit Tigers?

The current owners of the Detroit Tigers are Mike and Marian Ilitch. The Ilitches purchased the team in 1992 from Tom Monaghan.

#  How did the Tigers ownership change in 2017?

The Detroit Tigers experienced a change in ownership during the 2017 season. The team was previously owned by Mike Ilitch, who purchased the team in 1992. However, Ilitch passed away in February of 2017, and his widow Marian Ilitch became the new owner of the Tigers.

This change in ownership resulted in some changes for the Tigers organization. For example, Marian Ilitch quickly fired Tigers president and general manager Dave Dombrowski, who had been with the team since 2002. She also made some changes to the coaching staff, firing manager Brad Ausmus and several coaches.

Despite these changes, the Tigers still had a disappointing 2017 season. They finished with a record of 64-98, last place in the American League Central Division.

#  Who were the previous owners of the Detroit Tigers?

The Detroit Tigers were founded in 1894 and were originally called the Detroit Wolverines. The team was bought by William Hulbert, the owner of the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs) in 1881. In 1900, the Tigers were sold to Detroiter George Vanderbeck. John T. Brush purchased the team in 1903. In 1905, he sold it to Frank Navin who would be the owner until his death in 1931. In 1932, the team was sold to Walter Briggs who owned it until his death in 1952. William Yawkey purchased the team from Briggs' estate and owned it until his death in 1976. The current owner, Mike Ilitch, purchased the team from Yawkey's estate in 1992.

#  Why did the previous owners sell the Detroit Tigers?

The Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team that compete in the American League Central division. The team was founded in 1894 and has had a number of different owners over the years. However, in 2017, the previous owners announced that they were selling the team.

There were a number of reasons why the previous owners decided to sell the team. Firstly, they felt that they had taken the Tigers as far as they could and it was time for new ownership to take over and continue to build on their success. Additionally, they felt that they needed to focus on other business interests and weren't able to invest enough time and energy into running the Tigers. Finally, they believed that the Tigers were a good investment opportunity and believed that the new owners would be able to capitalize on the team's potential.

The new owners have already made some changes since taking over at the beginning of 2018. They have increased ticket prices, reduced player salaries and renegotiated some sponsorship deals. They are also looking to move the Tigers to a new stadium, which is likely to cost around $1 billion. Overall, it remains to be seen whether these changes will be beneficial for the team or not. However, it is clear that the new owners are keen to make a splash and improve Detroit Tigers' fortunes on and off the field.

#  What are the new owners plans for the Detroit Tigers?

The Detroit Tigers have a new owner, one that is looking to bring a championship to the city of Detroit. Chris Ilitch, who took over the team after his father's death, plans on doing whatever it takes to win. In an interview with the Detroit News, Ilitch said "I'm going to do whatever it takes to bring a championship here to Detroit."

Ilitch has been involved with the Tigers organization for many years, and is no stranger to winning. He is the founder of Little Caesar's Pizza, and is also the owner of the Detroit Red Wings. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Tigers organization, and is looking to make them a contender once again.

The Tigers have had their ups and downs in recent years. They made it to the World Series in 2006, but have failed to make the playoffs since then. Ilitch knows that he has a lot of work ahead of him, but he is excited about the challenge. "I'm not coming in here thinking we're going to snap our fingers and all of a sudden we're going to be at the top," he said. "But I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power possible to get us there."

Ilitch has already started making changes within the organization, firing Dave Dombrowski as president and general manager. He has brought in Al Avila as his new GM, and said that he plans on giving him full autonomy over baseball operations. Avila is familiar with the Tigers organization, having worked for them for many years. He has also won two World Series Championships as GM of the Miami Marlins.

Ilitch says that he wants Avila "to put his stamp on this team" and build it into a contender. He has also made some changes on the coaching staff, hiring Brad Ausmus as manager and Dave Clark as bench coach. Ausmus was previously manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Clark most recently served as bench coach for the Washington Nationals.

The Tigers will open their season on April 6th against the Minnesota Twins. Ilitch says that he is confident that they can be competitive this season, but warns fans not to expect too much too soon. "We're not trying to rebuild," he said. "We're trying to reload."
